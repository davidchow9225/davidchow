# [My Portfolio Website][1]

## Description
A static HTML &amp; CSS website that is meant to serve as a portfolio and digital resume.
Come with me as I adventure into front-end web development! :)

## Featured Pages
- Home Page (index.html)
- About Me Page (about-me.html)
- Projects Page (projects-page.html)
- Contact Page (contact-page.html)  

Currently all the stylizing is handled by one stylesheet (styles.css).  
Specific styling behavior is made possible with the functionality of HTML element classes.
